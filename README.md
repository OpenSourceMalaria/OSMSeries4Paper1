This repository is for the writing of the first paper about Series 4 of the Open Source Malaria Consortium. 
The paper will be assembled at http://tinyurl.com/OSM-S4-Paper1. Google Docs' commenting functionality is a little better than Github's for writing papers.
This repo will be used for i) sharing files (images, spreadsheets, PDFs etc) and ii) assembling a to-do list of things specific to the paper, for which we'll use the Issue Tracker ("Issues", above).
