This repository is for the writing of the first paper about Series 4 of the Open Source Malaria Consortium. 
To be involved in the research on Series 4, head over to the Series 4 repository (for the wiki) or the current To Do List (which has all the currently-active threads).
The paper will be assembled at http://tinyurl.com/OSM-S4-Paper1. Google Docs' commenting functionality is a little better than Github's for writing papers.
However, this repo will be used for i) sharing files and ii) assembling a to-do list (for which we'll use the Issue Tracker)
